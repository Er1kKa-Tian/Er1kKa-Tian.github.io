# ATO Aviation Sector Country Profiles

## Introduction

This is a project I built during my internship at [Asian Transport Observatory](https://asiantransportobservatory.org/). It aimed to provide individual overviews of the aviation sector in 52 Asian-Pacific economies. Each country profile focuses on 6 major topics: overview, operational benchmark, connectivity, environment, economy, and policy.

Apart from individual country profiles, I also developed insights at an aggregate level and provided a final presentation.

## Sample Output

A sample country profile for Indonesia can be accessed [here](ato_aviation_sample.md).

Here are some sample figures:
