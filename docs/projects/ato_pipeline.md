# ATO Priority Project Pipeline Database

## Introduction

This is a project I built during my internship at [Asian Transport Observatory](https://asiantransportobservatory.org/). It aimed to provide a collection of all priority transportation projects in 52 Asian-Pacific economies. The final output is a database containing 2,000+ individual projects with detailed costs, locations, timelines, descriptions, alignment with SDGs, etc.

I used mainly used Python for this project. The two most important packages are [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data wrangling and [pydoll](https://github.com/autoscrape-labs/pydoll) for web scrapping.
