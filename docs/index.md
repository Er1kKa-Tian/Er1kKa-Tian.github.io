## About Me :beers:

I'm a graduate student from [St Hilda's College, University of Oxford](https://www.st-hildas.ox.ac.uk/), currently enrolled in the [MPhil in Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/mphil-in-economics) programme. Previously, I got my [BSc Economics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/economics-bsc-econ) from UCL with [Eleanora Allen Prize](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/study/undergraduate/undergraduate-economics-prizes-and-winners).

I was once an intern at [Asian Transport Observatory](https://asiantransportobservatory.org/) and [UCL Institute for Global Prosperity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/global-prosperity).

I have interests in Heterodox Economics, Political Economy, Transportation (especially Railway and Aviation), Computer Science, Data Science, Photography, Music, Table Tennis, Swimming, Travelling, and Anime.

I used to play games a lot, including [Battlefield 1](https://battlefieldtracker.com/bf1/profile/origin/Er1kKa/overview), [Battlefield 5](https://battlefieldtracker.com/bfv/profile/origin/Er1kka/overview), Broken Arrow, Transport Fever, and MSFS.
