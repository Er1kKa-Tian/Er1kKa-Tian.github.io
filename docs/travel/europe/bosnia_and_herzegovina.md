# Bosnia and Herzegovina 2025.03

When Yangyang raised the possibility of visiting Bosnia, "Bosnia and Herzegovina" was still a vague and distant concept for me. My only knowledge of Bosnia came from casual readings about the Bosnian War in the 1990s and Yugoslavia. I've never been to Balkans, and I did not expect this 7-day trip to be such an unforgettable adventure.

???+ failure "Why France when there's Bosnia?"

    You know, Western Europe is too expensive and boring (everyone goes there for travelling), and you have to go through a complicated process of visa application. Meanwhile, the only thing you need to prepare for Bosnia is a 40GBP round flight ticket!

???+ info "Useful Bosnian Dialogue Expressions"

    According to our experience, when you are travelling to a region where you cannot speak the local language, learning the following expressions will dramatically improve your ability to communicate with the local:

    - Greetings: Hi! Thank you! $\to$ (Bosnian) Zdravo! Hvala!
    - Numbers 1-100 $\to$ (You can search on the web, but it's like a simpified version of Russian numbers)
    - Price negotiation: How much? It's too expensive. Cheaper please. $\to$ (Bosian) Koliko? Preskupo. Jeftinije, molim.
    - Asking for directions: Where is the $\to$ (Bosian) Gdje je ...?
    - Compliments: You are so beautiful/handsome! $\to$ (Bosian) Tako si lijep/zgodna!

    You can remember those expressions on your flight. Combined with body languages, those expressions are surprisingly effective! (You will see an example below.) 
    
    The only time we faced communication issue in Bosnia is when I tried to know whether there were eggd in a supermarket -- I really didn't know how to act like an egg.

### The Long March to Our Room

To ensure we wouldn't miss our flight, our journey started at 3AM in the morning. Back in February, Yangyang and I sometimes chatted until that time (in the dinning hall of St Antony's), but on March 23, we already got up for our excursion.

The first stop is Oxford Gloucester Bus Station where we took the National Express 737 to Gatwick. Surprisingly, there were a few other passengers onboard. I must complain about the horrible design of seats -- their shape perfectly went against human's spine, which made us extremely uncomfortable during that 2-hour journey.

Nevertheless, at least the bus was on time, and we went through all the procedures at Gatwick smoothly. By 07:45, we already seated on our flight to Sarajevo.

???+ tip "Wizz Air"

    You need to get everything ready before going to the airport. They even charge a fee for printing boarding passes at the airport!

    But you can't ask more considering their ticket fare, right?

(todo: airport)

???+ example "Taxi at Sarajevo Airport"

    For locals, the taxi fare from the airport to city centre is typically 20 KM/BAM. However, taxi drivers will charge more than 40 KM/BAM for tourists. BUT THAT WON'T BE THE CASE FOR US!
    
    Using the language expressions learned in the first section, you can negotiate price with the driver:

    - Zdravo! Koliko centar grada? (Hi! How much to the city centre. *Search for the word "centar grada" in advance.. and never care about grammar!*)
    - 40 KOM (*could be 30/50, but typically a high price*)
    - Preskupo.. Jeftinije, molim! 20 KOM! (Too expansive.. Cheaper, please! 20 KOM! *Remember to combine with emotions*)
    - (*Pretend to leave and look for other drivers*)
    - (*Now the drive will compromise and accept your 20 KOM offer lol*)

    We've tried and succeeded. Only understanding the basic language grants you additional advantage that you won't be able to understand any furious insults from the local driver :)
