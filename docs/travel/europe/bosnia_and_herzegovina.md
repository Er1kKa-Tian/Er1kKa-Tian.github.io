# Bosnia and Herzegovina 2025.03

When Yangyang raised the possibility of visiting Bosnia, "Bosnia and Herzegovina" was still a vague and distant concept for me. My only knowledge of Bosnia came from casual readings about the Bosnian War in the 1990s and Yugoslavia. I've never been to Balkans, and I did not expect this 7-day trip to be such an unforgettable adventure.

    You know, Western Europe is too expensive and boring (everyone goes there for travelling), and you have to go through a complicated process of visa application. Meanwhile, the only thing you need to prepare for Bosnia is a 40GBP round flight ticket!

???+ info "Useful Bosnian Dialogue Expressions"

    According to our experience, when you are travelling to a region where you cannot speak the local language, learning the following expressions will dramatically improve your ability to communicate with the local:

    - Greetings: Hi! Thank you! $\to$ (Bosnian) Zdravo! Hvala!
    - Numbers 1-100 $\to$ (You can search on the web, but it's like a simpified version of Russian numbers)
    - Price negotiation: How much? It's too expensive. Cheaper please. $\to$ (Bosian) Koliko? Preskupo. Jeftinije, molim.
    - Asking for directions: Where is the $\to$ (Bosian) Gdje je ...?
    - Compliments: You are so beautiful/handsome! $\to$ (Bosian) Tako si lijep/zgodna!

    You can remember those expressions on your flight. Combined with body languages, those expressions are surprisingly effective! (You will see an example below.) 
    
    The only time we faced communication issue in Bosnia is when I tried to know whether there were eggd in a supermarket -- I really didn't know how to act like an egg.

### The Long March to Our Room

To ensure we wouldn't miss our flight, our journey started at 3AM in the morning. Back in February, Yangyang and I sometimes chatted until that time (in the dinning hall of St Antony's), but on March 23, we already got up for our excursion.

The first stop is Oxford Gloucester Bus Station where we took the National Express 737 to Gatwick. Surprisingly, there were a few other passengers onboard. I must complain about the horrible design of seats -- their shape perfectly went against human's spine, which made us extremely uncomfortable during that 2-hour journey.

???+ tip "Wizz Air"

    You need to get everything ready before going to the airport. They even charge a fee for printing boarding passes at the airport!

    But you can't ask more considering their ticket fare, right?


Nevertheless, at least the bus was on time, and we went through all the procedures at Gatwick smoothly. By 07:45, we already seated on our flight to Sarajevo.

The flight was smooth and we got a beautiful glimpse of snow-capped mountains when crossing Switzerland.


As there's no convenient public transportation going from Sarajevo airport to the city centre, we dicided to take a taxi. Taxies at the aiport are notoriously known for overcharging tourist, but we had been well prepared for that --- using our carefully preplanned tactics:

    ???+ inline end "Official Fares"

        ![Official Fares](/assets/bosnia/sarajevo_taxi.jpg){ width="300"}

    For locals, the taxi fare from the airport to city centre is typically 20 KM/BAM. However, taxi drivers will charge more than 40 KM/BAM for tourists. BUT THAT WON'T BE THE CASE FOR US!
    
    Using the language expressions learned in the first section, you can negotiate price with the driver:

    - Zdravo! Koliko centar grada? (Hi! How much to the city centre. *Search for the word "centar grada" in advance.. and never care about grammar!*)
    - 40 KOM (*could be 30/50, but typically a high price*)
    - Preskupo.. Jeftinije, molim! 20 KOM! (Too expansive.. Cheaper, please! 20 KOM! *Remember to combine with emotions*)
    - (*Pretend to leave and look for other drivers*)
    - (*Now the drive will compromise and accept your 20 KOM offer lol*)

    We've tried and succeeded. Only understanding the basic language grants you additional advantage that you won't be able to understand any furious insults from the local driver :)

The real trouble started after we arrived at the building where our Airbnb room located. 

We did not purchase a SIM card at the airport since we deemed there should be better options. Since we also did not having roaming services, we were basically cut off from the internet. The only clue about our airbnb location was a couple of esoteric Bosnian sentences received from our host, which we couldn't decipher.

We first located the building --- which was fairly easy since it's named using the format of "street + number", and Yangyang had stayed in that room a few years ago. However, finding the exact room was a huge challenge. In that Soviet-style residential building, there was not a number system for the rooms. Instead, each room had its own name in Bosnian, so we couldn't even know on which floor was our room! The breakthrough came from the host's message: I noticed there was a word "četiri" --- sounds like "четыре" in Russian, which means number "4". Combined with the fact that both are Slavic languages, I inferred that our room should be on the 4th floor. Then, Yangyang came up with the genius idea of using her phone to try connecting to Wifi from each of the rooms, and that method worked. We also noticed that room's name also somewhere in the host's message, so we became certain about our conclusion --- we plugged in the key, and the door opened.

### WEEKENDS ARE WEEKENDS!

That room made me feel nostalgic the moment I stepped in. It's hard to precisely describe why, but everything was so familiar as if I had been there before. There were some lads playing football outside. Accompanied by that sound, under slight dizziness caused by low fever, I got a small nap on the sofa, feeling like a normal afternoon 15 years ago in the old apartment where my childhood remains.

At around 4pm, we decided to walk to the city centre and find some food. After crossing the Milajcka River, we saw some people walking alongside the river bank --- parents and children mostly. They walked on the centre of the road as there's not a single car around. We only saw some traffic after getting to Zmaja od Bosne (Dragon of Bosnia) street, the main axis of Sarajevo city which located in a East-West valley. The iconic trams also run on that street. Cars were generally smaller than elsewhere and significant tear and wear could be spotted.

There was hardly anyone in the city centre. We walked around, and all businesses were closed --- including the largest shopping mall Sarajevo SCC and the KFC inside. On the other side of the street located the parliament, there's even no guard or police around or inside the parliament! Supposedly, criminal and protestors were also taking the Saturday off. Everyone was taking Saturday seriously as a day for rest but not for work --- an equilibrium hardly any economists would think of unless they saw it.

Luckily, there's a cafe still open. It's the Caribou Coffee, and Yangyang had been there in her last visit. Probably due to the weather, or because he felt bad to be the only person working on Saturday in the country, the manager was not as enthusiastic as in Yangyang's last visit. Nevertheless, the food was still delicious, and the chicken sandwich was served to me after being heated in the microwave, which is something the British had yet to learn.

We also met a Chinese man in the cafe. I thought he was someone working here, but he turned out to be a marathon runner who had just finished the Mostar Marathon. He was the only Chinese we met on that day, and indeed the only one apart from some tourist groups with Shanghai accent in the following days. We did not see any Chinese business during our whole trip --- quite surprising to me at least.

We picked another way home, along which located small monuments, parks, and low office buildings (actually a UN office). Before reaching our destination, we were fortunate enough to find the second open business --- a convenient store in a gasoline station. No one spoke English there, but somehow we got no trouble in purchasing some snacks and drinks.

(By now, I realised I probably included too many details, but writing those seems to have revived plenty of memories that I nearly forget, especially the feeling of walking alongside Yangyang in that gloomy dusk. The slight discomfort from fever, nervousness from unknown environment, roaring wind, circling crows, but her warm hands holding mine --- something made me immersed into and cannot stop.)

Anyway, that was the first day. Time for a good night of sleep.
