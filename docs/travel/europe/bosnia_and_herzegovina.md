# Bosnia and Herzegovina 2025.03

When Yangyang raised the possibility of visiting Bosnia, "Bosnia and Herzegovina" was still a vague and distant concept for me. My only knowledge of Bosnia came from casual readings about the Bosnian War in the 1990s and Yugoslavia. I've never been to Balkans, and I did not expect this 7-day trip to be such an unforgettable adventure.

    You know, Western Europe is too expensive and boring (everyone goes there for travelling), and you have to go through a complicated process of visa application. Meanwhile, the only thing you need to prepare for Bosnia is a 40GBP round flight ticket!

???+ info "Useful Bosnian Dialogue Expressions"

    According to our experience, when you are travelling to a region where you cannot speak the local language, learning the following expressions will dramatically improve your ability to communicate with the local:

    - Greetings: Hi! Thank you! $\to$ (Bosnian) Zdravo! Hvala!
    - Numbers 1-100 $\to$ (You can search on the web, but it's like a simpified version of Russian numbers)
    - Price negotiation: How much? It's too expensive. Cheaper please. $\to$ (Bosian) Koliko? Preskupo. Jeftinije, molim.
    - Asking for directions: Where is the $\to$ (Bosian) Gdje je ...?
    - Compliments: You are so beautiful/handsome! $\to$ (Bosian) Tako si lijep/zgodna!

    You can remember those expressions on your flight. Combined with body languages, those expressions are surprisingly effective! (You will see an example below.) 
    
    The only time we faced communication issue in Bosnia is when I tried to know whether there were eggd in a supermarket -- I really didn't know how to act like an egg.


## Sarajevo

### The Long March to Our Room

To ensure we wouldn't miss our flight, our journey started at 3AM in the morning. Back in February, Yangyang and I sometimes chatted until that time (in the dinning hall of St Antony's), but on March 23, we already got up for our excursion.

The first stop is Oxford Gloucester Bus Station where we took the National Express 737 to Gatwick. Surprisingly, there were a few other passengers onboard. I must complain about the horrible design of seats -- their shape perfectly went against human's spine, which made us extremely uncomfortable during that 2-hour journey.

???+ tip "Wizz Air"

    You need to get everything ready before going to the airport. They even charge a fee for printing boarding passes at the airport!

    But you can't ask more considering their ticket fare, right?


Nevertheless, at least the bus was on time, and we went through all the procedures at Gatwick smoothly. By 07:45, we already seated on our flight to Sarajevo.

The flight was smooth and we got a beautiful glimpse of snow-capped mountains when crossing Switzerland.


As there's no convenient public transportation going from Sarajevo airport to the city centre, we dicided to take a taxi. Taxies at the aiport are notoriously known for overcharging tourist, but we had been well prepared for that --- using our carefully preplanned tactics:

???+ example "Taxi at Sarajevo Airport"

    ???+ inline end "Official Fares"

        ![Official Fares](/assets/bosnia/sarajevo_taxi.jpg){ width="300"}

    For locals, the taxi fare from the airport to city centre is typically 20 KM/BAM. However, taxi drivers will charge more than 40 KM/BAM for tourists. BUT THAT WON'T BE THE CASE FOR US!
    
    Using the language expressions learned in the first section, you can negotiate price with the driver:

    - Zdravo! Koliko centar grada? (Hi! How much to the city centre. *Search for the word "centar grada" in advance.. and never care about grammar!*)
    - 40 KOM (*could be 30/50, but typically a high price*)
    - Preskupo.. Jeftinije, molim! 20 KOM! (Too expansive.. Cheaper, please! 20 KOM! *Remember to combine with emotions*)
    - (*Pretend to leave and look for other drivers*)
    - (*Now the drive will compromise and accept your 20 KOM offer lol*)

    We've tried and succeeded. Only understanding the basic language grants you additional advantage that you won't be able to understand any furious insults from the local driver :)

The real trouble started after we arrived at the building where our Airbnb room located. 

We did not purchase a SIM card at the airport since we deemed there should be better options. Since we also did not having roaming services, we were basically cut off from the internet. The only clue about our airbnb location was a couple of esoteric Bosnian sentences received from our host, which we couldn't decipher.

We first located the building --- which was fairly easy since it's named using the format of "street + number", and Yangyang had stayed in that room a few years ago. However, finding the exact room was a huge challenge. In that Soviet-style residential building, there was not a number system for the rooms. Instead, each room had its own name in Bosnian, so we couldn't even know on which floor was our room! The breakthrough came from the host's message: I noticed there was a word "četiri" --- sounds like "четыре" in Russian, which means number "4". Combined with the fact that both are Slavic languages, I inferred that our room should be on the 4th floor. Then, Yangyang came up with the genius idea of using her phone to try connecting to Wifi from each of the rooms, and that method worked. We also noticed that room's name also somewhere in the host's message, so we became certain about our conclusion --- we plugged in the key, and the door opened.

### WEEKENDS ARE WEEKENDS!

That room made me feel nostalgic the moment I stepped in. It's hard to precisely describe why, but everything was so familiar as if I had been there before. There were some lads playing football outside. Accompanied by that sound, under slight dizziness caused by low fever, I got a small nap on the sofa, feeling like a normal afternoon 15 years ago in the old apartment where my childhood remains.

At around 4pm, we decided to walk to the city centre and find some food. After crossing the Milajcka River, we saw some people walking alongside the river bank --- parents and children mostly. They walked on the centre of the road as there's not a single car around. We only saw some traffic after getting to Zmaja od Bosne (Dragon of Bosnia) street, the main axis of Sarajevo city which located in a East-West valley. The iconic trams also run on that street. Cars were generally smaller than elsewhere and significant tear and wear could be spotted.

There was hardly anyone in the city centre. We walked around, and all businesses were closed --- including the largest shopping mall Sarajevo SCC and the KFC inside. On the other side of the street located the parliament, there's even no guard or police around or inside the parliament! Supposedly, criminal and protestors were also taking the Sunday off. Everyone was taking Sunday seriously as a day for rest but not for work --- an equilibrium hardly any economists would think of unless they saw it.

Luckily, there's a cafe still open. It's the Caribou Coffee, and Yangyang had been there in her last visit. Probably due to the weather, or because he felt bad to be the only person working on Sunday in the country, the manager was not as enthusiastic as in Yangyang's last visit. Nevertheless, the food was still delicious, and the chicken sandwich was served to me after being heated in the microwave, which is something the British had yet to learn.

We also met a Chinese man in the cafe. I thought he was someone working here, but he turned out to be a marathon runner who had just finished the Mostar Marathon. He was the only Chinese we met on that day, and indeed the only one apart from some tourist groups with Shanghai accent in the following days. We did not see any Chinese business during our whole trip --- quite surprising to me at least.

We picked another way home, along which located small monuments, parks, and low office buildings (actually a UN office). Before reaching our destination, we were fortunate enough to find the second open business --- a convenient store in a gasoline station. No one spoke English there, but somehow we got no trouble in purchasing some snacks and drinks.

(By now, I realised I probably included too many details, but writing those seems to have revived plenty of memories that I nearly forget, especially the feeling of walking alongside Yangyang in that gloomy dusk. The slight discomfort from fever, nervousness from unknown environment, roaring wind, circling crows, but her warm hands holding mine --- something made me immersed into and cannot stop.)

Anyway, that was the first day. Time for a good night of sleep.

### Locals and Visitors

    ![papermoon](/assets/bosnia/sarajevo_papermoon.jpg){ width="300" }

The weather was still cloudy on our second day. Somehow we skipped for the breakfast and opted for a hearty lunch. With extreme hunger and excitement from escaping British food, we ordered a steak, chicken pasta, and prawn salad from a nearby restaurant named "Paper Moon". Though located in an old apartment building, the restaurant itself was well decorated. I have to be honest that the price was sure not cheap (in the Bosnian sense), but the exceptional taste and amount instantly proved its value. As we enjoying our gourmet dishes, some shiny cars that did not fit in the street view parked outside, and people wearing suits seated down around another table. They seemed to be frequent visitors here. We couldn't understand what they were chatting, but probably not about the delicious food I suppose.

???+ info inline end "Yangyang and the Cats"

    ![cats](/assets/bosnia/sarajevo_cats.jpg){ width="200" }

On the way home, we encountered some unexpected locals -- cats. The fluffy guys probably had 7-day weekends per week, as they just kept lying on a sofa, not even reacting to our approach. Another surprise is that we accidentally walked into a local market hidden behind buildings where a few elders were selling fruits and vegetables. With Bosnian phrases learned from 30min Youtube videos a mixture with Russian words, I somehow successfully bought a couple of apples and bananas, which offered me a feeling of competency that I never had on a foreign language before. Of course, I soon had to re-evaluate my mastery in Bosnian as I tried to purchase a SIM card and struggled to explain when the saleslady seemed to be doubting my cash as counterfeit.

Under the long-awaited sunshine, we decided to have another trip to see the landmarks of Sarajevo. After a short while of waiting under some curious eyesights from the locals, we hopped on a tram heading to the Latin Bridge (Latinska ćuprija) where Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated. Our tram driver, who was surprisingly patient and friendly, somehow understood our destinations and carefully handed me the ticket and changes.

We finally saw other tourists while walking around the Latin Bridge --- but only a few, not even comparable to the most deserted season in Nanjing, which again surprised me, considering how well-know is the assassination. Located north-eastern to the Latin Bridge was the Baščaršija, a bustling market with 600 years of history. Just as typical tourist attractions elsewhere, dazzling gadgets, blankets, drawings appeared everywhere with peddlers and shops all around. There seemed to be a huge tourist group from China with familiar Shanghai accents. Once I always wondered how merchants on the Silk Road made deals without understanding exotic languages along the way, a question answered lively by those tourists. Probably, "communication problem" is only a problem when one side want to shun away; when both sides were positive to getting the business done, you can answer Bosnian with Shanghainess.

### A City where You Cannot Ignore Its History

Marching all the way to the east, the journey started to be more tiring as we climbed to the Yellow Fortress. Looking upward, there were patches of graves all over the hill --- some in the cross shape and some in other styles, but mostly white. Having only minor decays, those graves appeared to be the most modern human artefacts around. The Yellow Fortress, on the mid-hill, provided a perfect panorama for the Sarajevo city under the tilting sun.

!!! quote "Written by Yangyang"

    We climbed slowly toward the Yellow Fortress, and the cobbled path curling upward past rows of white graves. The white graves stood like silent sentinels on the hillside, their marble faces aglow in the day’s last light. From a distance, they seemed to watch over the city. Sarajevo is built not only on stone and soil, but on the bones and memories of those who came before.

    From the hilltop, the city unfolded beneath us—red roofs, minarets, church towers, and streets winding like threads between them. Yet the view was not only beautiful; it was heavy with what had passed here. The dissolution of Yugoslavia, the siege, the war—they had left their marks, etched into walls and woven into air. History here does not retire quietly to books or museums; it lingers, clinging to bullet-pocked facades, echoing in alleyways, waiting in the pause between footsteps.

    We were fortunate to catch a silver lining breaking through the mist after a sudden rain. In the fading light, Sarajevo seemed to breathe both sorrow and stillness, finding a balance between the two. Some wish history, especially those who have lived through it, to rest between the soil and the dawn. Others—unyielding—would let old blood seep once more into the city’s cracks, unwilling to see memory fade into quietness. This has always been my impression of Bosnia, in both the figurative and the physical. 

    Three decades on, Bosnia still bears its wounds in the form of unfinished buildings with skeletal frames of concrete that stand alone against the wind. It is hard to know how much this history has shaped the country's unhurried Sundays. Yet perhaps the past has made its people to embrace a slower rhythm, a quiet turning away from the grind toward a gentler, shared equilibrium.

    Later, we lingered over tea in a small café on the hill before making our way back to the city centre. The cobblestones, slick from the days of constant rain, made the descent treacherous, but thanks to Xiaotian’s warm & steady & lovely hand, I managed not to fall. Along the way, we met a group of children - likely Turkish, judging by a word we recognised, one taught to us by a friend whose talents span from Turkish, Swahili, to serious economic research. They were brimming with excitement, planning what sounded like a pizza party somewhere up in the hills.

    Further down, we encountered two rival gangs of cats - tails flicking, eyes narrowed, ears tilted in wary calculation. The battle of the fluffies hovered just on the edge of breaking out, the tension palpable (comical). 

    The downhill stretch on this side was gentler, the pace unhurried. The air smelled faintly of wet stone and woodsmoke, and with each step, the city seemed to rise toward us, slowly reclaiming us from the hills.
