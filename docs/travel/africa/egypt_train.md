# Abela Sleeper Train: Upper Egypt (Cairo) to Luxor/Aswan

**Date of Travel: 25/26 September 2025**

## Introduction

Travelling from the Pyramids in Cairo to the temples in Luxor on a 1980 East Germany made train! This one-night sleeper train experience along the River Nile is definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Egypt.

Fares are different for citizens from Arab countries and foreigners. Foreigners can only purchase tickets using US Dollars for a much higher price.

Fares also differ for online bookings and in-station purchases. In October, for foreigners travelling from Upper Egypt (Cairo) to Luxor, a solo occupancy cabin requires 157.5 USD / person, and a double occupancy cabin requires 110.25 USD / person. If you purchase at the counter, the price will be a flat rate of 105 USD / person for duo/solo occupancy. (I guess they can just put you in an empty room for duo rate when there are spare places.)

???+ Info "Online Booking and Refund"

    You can make bookings online at [Abela Trains official site](https://abelatrains.com/#/) or through their app. However, be aware that **there is (non-trivial) chance that the reservation can fail with your money paid!!!**

    I did face that situation, and I tried all possible ways to get a refund, including calling their numbers, sending WhatsApp, and writing emails. For me, the email method works. Their email addresses are support@abelatrains.com, info@abelatrains.com, and complain@abelatrains.com. I suggest to write to all of the above addresses if you need to refund. The money will typically be returned in a few weeks.

## Upper Egypt (Cairo) Station

### Getting to the Station

There are two main stations in Cairo: the old Ramses Station on the east bank of river Nile and the Upper Egypt Station on the west bank of river Nile. You can purchase tickets from either station, but sleeper trains leave from the Upper Egypt Station.

Compared with the old station located in the congested old Cairo city, the new Upper Egypt Station seems to have better road connectivity conditions. However, in reality, the complicated highway and road design around station is very hard to navigate through. Drivers frequently get lost around the station, so do leave early for the station!
