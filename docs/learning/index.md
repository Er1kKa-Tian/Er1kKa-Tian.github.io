# How I Got Here?

This part provides some stories and summaries of my journey of quest. ["23 Years in One Page"](learning_summary.md) is a (probably over simplified) account of my personal history. There are also specific stories, including some reflections and comments about the [BSc Economics at UCL](ucl_bsc_econ.md) and [MPhil Economics at Oxford](ox_mphil_econ.md) (written in Chinese). [The Grand Library of Er1kKa](library.md) contains short descriptions of teh books I read / courses I took.
