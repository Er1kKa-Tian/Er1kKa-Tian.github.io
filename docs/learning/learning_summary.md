## Introduction

Looking back at the path through which I got here, I saw great progress -- equally large is the gap between my current position and people who I admire. Yet both of those two distances are somewhat "travellable": I am confident that everyone can reach my current level of understandings (in a much faster manner than myself), and I am also confident that I will eventually finish the second part of the quest. Here I provide a summary of my journey of exploration to both reflect on myself and inspire others.
