# My Friends

## Their Personal Webs

My website is mainly for fun. There are probably more useful contents on my friends' sites :)

- [Haotian Bai](https://haotianbai.weebly.com/), my friend and classmate at Oxford, an excellent economic researcher.
- [Xialin He](https://xialin-he.github.io/), who has been my friend since middle school. I once thought he was going to be an astronomer, but he's now a cool computer scientist lol.
- [Yeyang Zhang (CSDN)](https://blog.csdn.net/zyy114514/) --- another good friend of mine since middle school, now specialised in EE at Fudan University.
