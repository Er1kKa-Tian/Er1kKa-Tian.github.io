<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>When Yangyang raised the possibility of visiting Bosnia, "Bosnia and Herzegovina" was still a vague and distant concept for me. My only knowledge of Bosnia came from casual readings about the Bosnian War in the 1990s and Yugoslavia. I've never been to Balkans, and I did not expect this 7-day trip to be such an unforgettable adventure.</p>

<summary>Why France when there's Bosnia?</summary>
<p>You know, Western Europe is too expensive and boring (everyone goes there for travelling), and you have to go through a complicated process of visa application. Meanwhile, the only thing you need to prepare for Bosnia is a 40GBP round flight ticket!</p>

<summary>Useful Bosnian Dialogue Expressions</summary>
<p>According to our experience, when you are travelling to a region where you cannot speak the local language, learning the following expressions will dramatically improve your ability to communicate with the local:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greetings: Hi! Thank you! <span class="arithmatex">\(\to\)</span> (Bosnian) Zdravo! Hvala!</li>

<h3 id="the-long-march-to-our-room">The Long March to Our Room</h3>
<p>To ensure we wouldn't miss our flight, our journey started at 3AM in the morning. Back in February, Yangyang and I sometimes chatted until that time (in the dinning hall of St Antony's), but on March 23, we already got up for our excursion.</p>
<p>The first stop is Oxford Gloucester Bus Station where we took the National Express 737 to Gatwick. Surprisingly, there were a few other passengers onboard. I must complain about the horrible design of seats -- their shape perfectly went against human's spine, which made us extremely uncomfortable during that 2-hour journey.</p>

<p>But you can't ask more considering their ticket fare, right?</p>
</details>
<p>Nevertheless, at least the bus was on time, and we went through all the procedures at Gatwick smoothly. By 07:45, we already seated on our flight to Sarajevo.</p>

<p>The flight was smooth and we got a beautiful glimpse of snow-capped mountains when crossing Switzerland.</p>
<p>As there's no convenient public transportation going from Sarajevo airport to the city centre, we dicided to take a taxi. Taxies at the aiport are notoriously known for overcharging tourist, but we had been well prepared for that --- using our carefully preplanned tactics:</p>

<p><img alt="Official Fares" loading="lazy" src="/assets/bosnia/sarajevo_taxi.jpg" width="300" /></p>
</details>
<p>For locals, the taxi fare from the airport to city centre is typically 20 KM/BAM. However, taxi drivers will charge more than 40 KM/BAM for tourists. BUT THAT WON'T BE THE CASE FOR US!</p>
<p>Using the language expressions learned in the first section, you can negotiate price with the driver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zdravo! Koliko centar grada? (Hi! How much to the city centre. <em>Search for the word "centar grada" in advance.. and never care about grammar!</em>)</li>
<li>40 KOM (<em>could be 30/50, but typically a high price</em>)</li>
<li>Preskupo.. Jeftinije, molim! 20 KOM! (Too expansive.. Cheaper, please! 20 KOM! <em>Remember to combine with emotions</em>)</li>
<li>(<em>Pretend to leave and look for other drivers</em>)</li>
<li>(<em>Now the drive will compromise and accept your 20 KOM offer lol</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We've tried and succeeded. Only understanding the basic language grants you additional advantage that you won't be able to understand any furious insults from the local driver :)</p>
</details>
<p>The real trouble started after we arrived at the building where our Airbnb room located. </p>
<p>We did not purchase a SIM card at the airport since we deemed there should be better options. Since we also did not having roaming services, we were basically cut off from the internet. The only clue about our airbnb location was a couple of esoteric Bosnian sentences received from our host, which we couldn't decipher.</p>
<p>We first located the building --- which was fairly easy since it's named using the format of "street + number", and Yangyang had stayed in that room a few years ago. However, finding the exact room was a huge challenge. In that Soviet-style residential building, there was not a number system for the rooms. Instead, each room had its own name in Bosnian, so we couldn't even know on which floor was our room! The breakthrough came from the host's message: I noticed there was a word "četiri" --- sounds like "четыре" in Russian, which means number "4". Combined with the fact that both are Slavic languages, I inferred that our room should be on the 4th floor. Then, Yangyang came up with the genius idea of using her phone to try connecting to Wifi from each of the rooms, and that method worked. We also noticed that room's name also somewhere in the host's message, so we became certain about our conclusion --- we plugged in the key, and the door opened.</p>

</details>
<p>That room made me feel nostalgic the moment I stepped in. It's hard to precisely describe why, but everything was so familiar as if I had been there before. There were some lads playing football outside. Accompanied by that sound, under slight dizziness caused by low fever, I got a small nap on the sofa, feeling like a normal afternoon 15 years ago in the old apartment where my childhood remains.</p>
<p>At around 4pm, we decided to walk to the city centre and find some food. After crossing the Milajcka River, we saw some people walking alongside the river bank --- parents and children mostly. They walked on the centre of the road as there's not a single car around. We only saw some traffic after getting to Zmaja od Bosne (Dragon of Bosnia) street, the main axis of Sarajevo city which located in a East-West valley. The iconic trams also run on that street. Cars were generally smaller than elsewhere and significant tear and wear could be spotted.</p>
<p>There was hardly anyone in the city centre. We walked around, and all businesses were closed --- including the largest shopping mall Sarajevo SCC and the KFC inside. On the other side of the street located the parliament, there's even no guard or police around or inside the parliament! Supposedly, criminal and protestors were also taking the Sunday off. Everyone was taking Sunday seriously as a day for rest but not for work --- an equilibrium hardly any economists would think of unless they saw it.</p>
<p>Luckily, there's a cafe still open. It's the Caribou Coffee, and Yangyang had been there in her last visit. Probably due to the weather, or because he felt bad to be the only person working on Sunday in the country, the manager was not as enthusiastic as in Yangyang's last visit. Nevertheless, the food was still delicious, and the chicken sandwich was served to me after being heated in the microwave, which is something the British had yet to learn.</p>
<p>We also met a Chinese man in the cafe. I thought he was someone working here, but he turned out to be a marathon runner who had just finished the Mostar Marathon. He was the only Chinese we met on that day, and indeed the only one apart from some tourist groups with Shanghai accent in the following days. We did not see any Chinese business during our whole trip --- quite surprising to me at least.</p>
<p>We picked another way home, along which located small monuments, parks, and low office buildings (actually a UN office). Before reaching our destination, we were fortunate enough to find the second open business --- a convenient store in a gasoline station. No one spoke English there, but somehow we got no trouble in purchasing some snacks and drinks.</p>
<p>(By now, I realised I probably included too many details, but writing those seems to have revived plenty of memories that I nearly forget, especially the feeling of walking alongside Yangyang in that gloomy dusk. The slight discomfort from fever, nervousness from unknown environment, roaring wind, circling crows, but her warm hands holding mine --- something made me immersed into and cannot stop.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that was the first day. Time for a good night of sleep.</p>

<p>The weather was still cloudy on our second day. Somehow we skipped for the breakfast and opted for a hearty lunch. With extreme hunger and excitement from escaping British food, we ordered a steak, chicken pasta, and prawn salad from a nearby restaurant named "Paper Moon". Though located in an old apartment building, the restaurant itself was well decorated. I have to be honest that the price was sure not cheap (in the Bosnian sense), but the exceptional taste and amount instantly proved its value. As we enjoying our gourmet dishes, some shiny cars that did not fit in the street view parked outside, and people wearing suits seated down around another table. They seemed to be frequent visitors here. We couldn't understand what they were chatting, but probably not about the delicious food I suppose.</p>

<summary>Yangyang and the Cats</summary>
<p><img alt="cats" loading="lazy" src="/assets/bosnia/sarajevo_cats.jpg" width="200" /></p>
</details>
<p>On the way home, we encountered some unexpected locals -- cats. The fluffy guys probably had 7-day weekends per week, as they just kept lying on a sofa, not even reacting to our approach. Another surprise is that we accidentally walked into a local market hidden behind buildings where a few elders were selling fruits and vegetables. With Bosnian phrases learned from 30min Youtube videos a mixture with Russian words, I somehow successfully bought a couple of apples and bananas, which offered me a feeling of competency that I never had on a foreign language before. Of course, I soon had to re-evaluate my mastery in Bosnian as I tried to purchase a SIM card and struggled to explain when the saleslady seemed to be doubting my cash as counterfeit.</p>
<p>Under the long-awaited sunshine, we decided to have another trip to see the landmarks of Sarajevo. After a short while of waiting under some curious eyesights from the locals, we hopped on a tram heading to the Latin Bridge (Latinska ćuprija) where Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated. Our tram driver, who was surprisingly patient and friendly, somehow understood our destinations and carefully handed me the ticket and changes.</p>
<p>We finally saw other tourists while walking around the Latin Bridge --- but only a few, not even comparable to the most deserted season in Nanjing, which again surprised me, considering how well-know is the assassination. Located north-eastern to the Latin Bridge was the Baščaršija, a bustling market with 600 years of history. Just as typical tourist attractions elsewhere, dazzling gadgets, blankets, drawings appeared everywhere with peddlers and shops all around. There seemed to be a huge tourist group from China with familiar Shanghai accents. Once I always wondered how merchants on the Silk Road made deals without understanding exotic languages along the way, a question answered lively by those tourists. Probably, "communication problem" is only a problem when one side want to shun away; when both sides were positive to getting the business done, you can answer Bosnian with Shanghainess.</p>

<h3 id="a-city-where-you-cannot-ignore-its-history">A City where You Cannot Ignore Its History</h3>
<p>Marching all the way to the east, the journey started to be more tiring as we climbed to the Yellow Fortress. Looking upward, there were patches of graves all over the hill --- some in the cross shape and some in other styles, but mostly white. Having only minor decays, those graves appeared to be the most modern human artefacts around. The Yellow Fortress, on the mid-hill, provided a perfect panorama for the Sarajevo city under the tilting sun.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Written by Yangyang</p>
<p>We climbed slowly toward the Yellow Fortress, and the cobbled path curling upward past rows of white graves. The white graves stood like silent sentinels on the hillside, their marble faces aglow in the day’s last light. From a distance, they seemed to watch over the city. Sarajevo is built not only on stone and soil, but on the bones and memories of those who came before.</p>
<p>From the hilltop, the city unfolded beneath us - red roofs, minarets, church towers, and streets winding like threads between them. Yet the view was not only beautiful; it was heavy with what had passed here. The dissolution of Yugoslavia, the siege, the war - they had left their marks, etched into walls and woven into air. History here does not retire quietly to books or museums; it lingers, clinging to bullet-pocked facades, echoing in alleyways, waiting in the pause between footsteps.</p>
<p>We were fortunate to catch a silver lining breaking through the mist after a sudden rain. In the fading light, Sarajevo seemed to breathe both sorrow and stillness, finding a balance between the two. Some wish history, especially those who have lived through it, to rest between the soil and the dawn. Others - unyielding - would let old blood seep once more into the city’s cracks, unwilling to see memory fade into quietness. This has always been my impression of Bosnia, in both the figurative and the physical. </p>
<p>Three decades on, Bosnia still bears its wounds in the form of unfinished buildings with skeletal frames of concrete that stand alone against the wind. It is hard to know how much this history has shaped the country's unhurried Sundays. Yet perhaps the past has made its people to embrace a slower rhythm, a quiet turning away from the grind toward a gentler, shared equilibrium.</p>
<p>Later, we lingered over tea in a small café on the hill before making our way back to the city centre. The cobblestones, slick from the days of constant rain, made the descent treacherous, but thanks to Xiaotian’s warm &amp; steady &amp; lovely hand, I managed not to fall. Along the way, we met a group of children - likely Turkish, judging by a word we recognised, one taught to us by a friend whose talents span from Turkish, Swahili, to serious economic research. They were brimming with excitement, planning what sounded like a pizza party somewhere up in the hills.</p>
<p>Further down, we encountered two rival gangs of cats - tails flicking, eyes narrowed, ears tilted in wary calculation. The battle of the fluffies hovered just on the edge of breaking out, the tension palpable (comical). </p>
<p>The downhill stretch on this side was gentler, the pace unhurried. The air smelled faintly of wet stone and woodsmoke, and with each step, the city seemed to rise toward us, slowly reclaiming us from the hills. </p>

<p><span class="arithmatex">\(\uparrow\)</span> Her words are so delicate while engaging, which made my writings completely lackluster. This story would be much more attractive had it been written by her. Yet please allow me to take over for this moment :)</p>
<p>Finding nice food had always been a headache for me. Luckily, Yangyang could always help me out with her acumen -- for the dinner, she picked a restaurant near the University of Sarajevo. We took another ride on the historic tram. With dim light in the cabin, the old train staggered across the city. Only the shining advertisement screen reminded us that we were still in our modern age. When we alighted, the sky had turned into dark indigo. Hastened by our hungry stomaches, we quickly rushed into the restaurants and enjoyed another delicious meal of risottos.</p>
<p>Apart from us, there were two groups of customers inside --- one group of ladies and another of men. Among the ladies, the elderly ones kindly talked and smiled with the others, but a nuanced formality and respectfulness still hovered over. Meanwhile, the men group seemed to be just laid back, filling the small restaurants with their laughs. We couldn't understand their chats, but guessing them provided a nice entertainment for our curious minds.</p>
<p>The night turned chilly as we walked out the restaurant. As a final stop of the day, we sneaked into the university campus and took a short tour. Compared with historic universities with grandiose churches and fancy decorations in West Europe, University of Sarajevo were more similar to the old campuses of Chinese Universities, with less sense of authority and stateliness but more practicality and familiarity. Maybe as it's already completely dark, no one even noticed us the two excited visitors. We took a nice photo at the main gate together with the university's badge -- which surprisingly had a similar colour and design as the one we were from (but better aesthetics I would argue).</p>

<p>Can't deny, Sarajevo might not be the most scenic city I've ever been to, but its significance is not comparable by the others for me. In Data Science, a new sample will provide a maximal amount of information if it's orthogonal to existing ones -- the experience in Sarajevo of that kind to me. There was still too much to learn and ponder. Two days are merely a glimpse in the history of a city or a nation, but for me, I will probably never forget -- those two days will have their firm place in the tiny history of myself, in which Yangyang and I enjoyed our first trip aboroad.</p>
<p>Under the history live all the lively individuals. We hear stories from the others, and we become stories of the others. I hope the words I've written down will be a prologue of a story of adventure, courage, struggle, and happiness. A story for us, a story for them.</p>

<p>The rain poured all night as we slept. The river Miljacka turned into a ferocious brown dragon, sweeping along everything that unluckily got into it. Under a single umbrella with our luggages, we carefully passed the bridge and managed to got into the Caribou Cafe. There were still hours before our train to Bosnia left, so we decided to have a quick review of the final exam, which would come in a month. With comfy tables and drinks, heavy rain instantly became the best harmony for esoteric econometrics, which made the revision session much enjoyable than in MRB. Lost in metric spaces, I accidentally poured hot tea over my hands. Extremely luckily, Yangyang brought the symptomatic medicine with her -- she was alway there when I'm in the most urgent need. Couldn't appreciate more.</p>
<p>Without notice, the world suddenly became bright -- while the raindrops still falling like dazzling diamonds. As we walked towards the train station, the city finally revealed its sunny side. Under the warm sunshine, Yugoslavia-era buildings and western style skyscrapers proudly stood side by side. Admiring the beauty along the way, we didn't spend much time until getting to the train station.</p>

<p>Though significantly lack maintenance, the grand design of the station recorded its prosperous yesterday. Now, the empty front yard rendered another kind of post-doomsday beauty. There were few travellers so we quickly purchased our tickets. (Somehow the ticket officer charged more than we supposed.)</p>
<p>Locating the correct train was not an easy task. We did not see any designated platform number or train number, and there seemed to be no indication of destinations on the train. Yet that wouldn't be a problem for us as it's already our third day there. After some enquiries (mostly in body languages), we successfully got on our train.</p>
<p>Compared with the clear disrepairs of platforms and tracks, the passenger coaches made by Talgo (a Spanish producer) were modern and quite well-maintained. In terms of interior decorations and layouts, they were even quite luxury. The 1st and 2nd classes, with 2+2 and 2+1 seating plans, were sold at the same price. Since there was no designated seat system and only a few people onboard, we can choose to seat whereever we'd like to. Settled down on two comfortable seats by a large window, we started our journey towards Mostar before the sunset.</p>

<h3 id="across-the-mountains">Across the Mountains</h3>
<p>The train crossed Sarajevo suburb to the west, passing the airport before entering the mountains. We kept climbing upwards after leaving the Blažuj station. Winding tracks along the slope limited the train speed and local connectivity, but meanwhile offered stunning views along the way. Yangyang and I couldn't stop taking photos -- from tranquil countrysides, historical villages, to high-rising snow mountains. Occasionally, the train stopped at stations with shorter than 10m "platforms", which reminded me of those commuting slow trains in Southwest China I travelled on a few years ago (though people didn't seem to bring fresh vegetables and livestocks onboard).</p>
<p>The highlight of this train journey was climbing over mountain pass between Grad and Konjic. The train climbed steeply from 500m to 800m through a sequence of horseshoe curves and tunnels, and then descended rapidly before approaching the historical town of Konjic with only 300m elevation. Under the beautiful afterglow, this railway heritage dated back to Austro-Hungarian Empire greeted us with a picturesque panorama of the vally.</p>

<p>After the excitement, I fell asleep for a while we descended further along the Neretva River all the way down to Mostar. The sky was completely dark when we finally arrived. Mostar station was really wield in design -- like a super low-cost version of small modern train station in China -- but at least it had every feature it needed for passenger services.</p>

<p>Located in a valley, Mostar was covered with light fog (or haze?) when we arrived. We walked for a while before arriving at our Airbnb, which was a top-floor 3-bedroom flat operated by a local couple. The hosts were nice and cordial. They showed us around and introduced the facilities. This giant flat was too much a luxury for the two of us -- I think this "party house" could easily fit in 10 occupants. Apart from some pungent smell from freshly resealed washroom, everything was perfect. There were even two balconies -- one with a panorama the historical old town and another one facing the mountain.</p>
<p>With agog stomachs and pro advices from our hosts, we decided to go for a food hunt in the night. Crossing the serene allies and the centuried old bridge, we chose a popular restaurant with a nice view of Neretva River. Its name Hindin Han -- I still have no clue about the meaning -- has become a place that I will never forget. The food there was so delicious that I would call it the "Jerusalem of Food", a haven that wandering taste buds dream for every night in the UK.</p>
<p>In our first visit, we ordered chicken with mushroom sauce and some grills. Let along the cheap price (compared with UK/EU/US), the mushroom sauce was the best within the genre, so was the chicken. However, the most extraordinary part had to be the local speciality -- veal -- a special kind of steak that's super tender that I cannot properly describe its exact taste. Together with fresh vegetables and chips, we enjoyed another fulfilling night in Bosnia.</p>
<h3 id="bad-weather-good-food-good-mood">Bad Weather, Good Food, Good Mood</h3>
<p>Our second day in Mostar, again, started with drizzle outside the window. Taking a view on the balcony, the old town was enveloped in mist and clouds. If the roof were in plain colour instead of crimson, I would have felt like staying in a historical town in Huangshan. We also got a new friend, caught in a water bottle, in the morning -- a Bosnian grasshopper. Its giant size reminded me of its foreign relatives in Anhui, which also surprised me with their huge size. Considering both places have great food, I'm sure that we can use some intricated econometrics tools to reveal the causal story behind, and show how feeding grasshoppers well will improve food quality, hence improving welfare. This is also the first time that I got to know that "grasshopper" is the same as "locust". Maybe the former sounds more positive, but the second will be more professional if our article <em>Why Foods Fail? Evidence from Inclusive Insects</em> is seeking a place in the <em>Journal of Political Eating</em>.</p>
<details class="inline end example" open="open">
<summary>How We Got Our New Friend</summary>
<p>You might be wondering how we got this grasshopper --- catching a grasshopper is not something you will do as the first task in the morning right? Probably yes, unless it's on your bed! During the night, I've already heard some noise, but I did not pay much attension as I was too tired. Yet in the early morning, I heard a loud scream fron Yangyang: she said that some unidentified creature was on her leg! I got up and initially saw nothing, but Yangyang was so afraid about the possibility of it being a PzKpfw VIII. Thus we searched around, and eventually found our new friend.</p>
</details>
<p>Jokes aside, as we went out to explore the town, the rain showed no trace of stopping, and there were few people on the street. Fierce torrents were even wilder than in Sarajevo, smashing plants and trees. The flood crawled above the riverbank into restaurants, turning them into Venice (or maybe Titanic) style. However, we also spotted brave warriors against the angry Alpheus -- a crowd of ducks. Rather than a struggle, the weather was a pure blessing for them: floating leaves and foods continually drifted from upstream, offering the ducks a wonderful buffet. I'm sure this would be another myths among the ducks for the coming generations -- a story of the grace of gods' presence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we did not envy the ducks as we were also enjoying the best food in our second visit to Hindin Han. As a breakfast, we tried the traditional Bosnian coffee and the soups. The chicken soup, with carrots, herbs, and noodles inside, was so delicious that I doubt it's stolen from my grandma's kitchen. Accompanied by the "dynamic" Balkan music circulated in the riverside balcony, we started our first morning in Mostar.</p>
<p>However, only eating in restaurants would never be enough to fully appreciate the food culture of a place, to eat like Bosnians (but with Chinese style), we decided to buy some food from the local supermarket and cook by ourselves. After being welcomed by a cat at the entrance, we entered the supermarket and started to hunt for inputs of our food production function. After a bit struggle and teamwork, Yangyang and I successfully concurred the Bosian weighting and vending machine, and got some noodles, meat, vegetables, and fruits. Sausages seemed to be a popular choice among the locals. Their tastes have already surprised us at Hindin Han, so we bought some frozen ones to see the taste difference between paid labour and self employment. We also purchased some fish fingers to have a fallback option in case our culinary skills turned out to be incompatible with Bosnian sausage. Yet in the end, despite some trials and errors in cooking, both of them ended up taste great.</p>
<p>After a short snap in the afternoon, it's finally the time for revision --- this is definitely one of the pros of travelling to a relatively cheap destination: you can spend half a day just studying or reading in a random cafe without feeling regretful of the money spent. We chose another branch of Caribou Cafe located in the northern part of the town, where we were treated with great coffee and tea. As a bonus, the barista lady, whom we guessed to be a student at UWC, even showed us a private room with a large table for study. We also visited an adjacent accessory store for notebooks, where we met a super chatterbox cashier --- could be the shop owner as he seemed to be the only employee there. We believed that he was so talkative that it's a loss of he did not campaign to the president (actually one of the presidents as there were three of them in Bosnia). Anyway, thanks to the quiet and comfortable environment, as well as the high quality notebook we got, Yangyang and I spent a productive afternoon reviewing for our final exams, which I though might be the most "painless" revision session in our cohort, considering our colleagues were still trapped in the cursed libraries or accommodations in Oxford. </p>
<p>It was already 7pm as our revision ended for that day. Half-a-day hard work made us wanna to try something different for our dinner, so we went to another restaurant with top reviews and recommended by our host --- the Urban Taste of the Orient. This restaurant turned out to be significantly more expansive than Hindin Han. Though the taste was still supreme --- actually we would rate it to be top of the tier if we were in the UK, we still got a bit disappointed compared with Hindin Han, also because we couldn't enjoy its highlight, view of the old bridge and river, due to chilly weather.</p>

<p>Our lives were quite calm but still exciting on the following two days in Mostar. We more or less got used to the local lifestyle --- as if we were visiting students there. There were some chocolates with "UWC Mostar" printed on their covers, so we supposed our hosts might have some connections with it. We walked around and explored the serene town in the morning --- the weather expelled nearly tourists and revealed the most authentic flavour Mostar. Then, we got back home and cooked our own food. More Chinese elements were added in the second and third day: though no one had probably thought about cooking tomato and egg stir fry in a Bosnian airbnb, it did happen. Following a snap was a revision session until the night, when we went to Hindin Han for nice treats, and then called it a day.</p>
<p>Alongside doing all the revisions, I also searched and applied to some internship positions at UNESCAP. Though later it turned out that none of them was successful, exploring and planning my life while discussing with Yangyang made me assuring. Interacting with new environment, new people, new opportunities, but with my loved and familiar one (and with a cup of oat vanilla latte) --- something that I really enjoyed.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on-they-and-us">Moving On, They and Us</h2>
<p>On the last day, we left our temporary home before sunrise. Crossing sleeping streets, we said goodbye to this thousands years old town. Along the same route through which we came, our train ran nimbly towards Sarajevo. Throughout this train journey and later on the flight to London, Yangyang slept well on my shoulders and knees. Sunshine gently shed on my face --- at that moment, I started to realise this trip has something more remarkable for both of us than a short escape before exams.</p>
<p>We spent only one week on our trip to BiH, but writing down this story has taken me more than two months (I started in August, and now it's October) --- mostly due to my laziness for sure. Looking back at different time spots (and different physical locations) across the two months, my feelings were also quite different --- as this trip becoming more and more distant in my memory, some details inevitably faded, but it's not converging to some "good old days" with reminiscence --- simply because every day is getting better since I met Yangynag. In that sense, if this trip eventually collapsed to a single point in my memory, it's likely to have a name as the singularity our life journey together.</p>
